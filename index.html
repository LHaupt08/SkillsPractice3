                    <h1>Volunteer Opportunities:</h1>

                    <p>Volunteers are the lifeblood of the Mt Pleasant Animal Shelter. We welcome volunteers of all ages, but 
those under 18 must volunteer with a family member.</p>

                    <p> To volunteer, you must attend an orientation session, which are held monthly. You also must complete 
the Volunteer Application2017. Complete it and bring with you to orientation.</p>

                    <p>Orientation should last about 1 hour, then you will set up your first volunteering time with a mentor 
who is an experienced volunteer to show you the ins and out of everything we do here. After that you 
will be certified to volunteer on your own.</p>

                    <h2>A few notes:</h2>
